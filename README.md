1. 🍫 Chocolate Sales Intelligence System
An end-to-end data analytics suite designed to transform raw sales records into actionable business insights. This project demonstrates a modular Python architecture for data processing and a automated Excel      dashboard for executive reporting.

🚀 Project Overview
  This repository contains two primary analytical solutions:

  Automated Excel Pipeline: A Power Query-driven dashboard for real-time KPI tracking.

  Python Analytics Suite: A modular Python environment for deep-dive statistical analysis and trend forecasting.

🏗️ Technical Architecture (Python)
  The Python project is built using a modular design pattern to ensure data consistency and code reusability.

  chocolate_analyzer.py: The "Source of Truth" module. It handles data ingestion, currency normalization, and feature engineering (e.g., calculating Price per Box).

  visualizer.py: The visualization layer that imports cleaned data to generate strategic insights.

  analysis_notebook.ipynb: An interactive environment used for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

📈 Key Business Insights
  Based on the analysis of ~3,200 records ($19.8M in revenue):

  Top Performing Market: Australia ($3.6M+) leads in total revenue.

  High-Margin Products: Identified Almond Choco and White Choc as premium drivers with the highest average price per box (~$42).

  Sales Rockstars: The top 25% of the sales team generates over 40% of the total revenue, suggesting a "mentor-protégé" training opportunity.
